# Sentiment Analysis Project
I have worked as a Data Scientist for this project which uses R language and SAS tools to apply the sentiment analysis.
# Project Objectives:
This project aims to apply sentiment analysis for Tweeter posts related to set of restaurants.

Following is a screenshot for the word cloud generated for the mentioned restaurant in R lanaguage:

Following screenshot is the model in SAS Enterprise Miner:

However, following figure is for the results of the Text Rule Builder node of the second instance (80%,20%,0%), showing the good fit of the model in both Train and Validation sets of the data:

Results Analysis and Discussion:
#	Result Comparison and Technical Finding:
•	Although used R code has helped to get the total percentage of positive and negative reviews and the world cloud for each restaurant, it does not provide some text mining services provided by SAS Enterprise Miner such as the text rules, text clusters, and text topics. These additional text mining services can help a lot to drill down on advanced aspects of the reviews such as the clusters of the reviews. Consequently, this can help the business users to identify the strong and weak points for business improvement purposes.
•	SAS Enterprise Miner is more efficient than R studio in terms of the time required to pre-process the text and apply the models.
•	A detailed discussion on the results obtained from the two tools (R & SAS Enterprise Miner) were included in the previous sections of classification on R and SAS.
#	Conclusion:
Sentiment analysis is one of the techniques that have been widely used nowadays specially to explore people`s sentiments on social media channels. Therefore, the aim of this research was to analyse the sentiments for the users of 30 restaurants based on their reviews. 
All the objectives of this research were met as follows:
1)	First objective was to research the academic literature related to the sentiment analysis techniques. The literature review section of this research started by defining the sentiment analysis and exploring its roots to the 70s. Then, the different methodological approaches of sentiment analysis were discussed. Finally, the selected approach for this research was selected.
2)	Second objective was to analyse the sentiments of 30 restaurant`s users via their reviews. A detailed sentiment analysis was applied for the selected 30 restaurants by using R studio and SAS Enterprise Miner tools.
3)	Third objective was to analyse and discuss the results of applied sentiment analysis technique. A detailed discussion of the applied sentiment analysis was included in each section (R & SAS). Furthermore, section (Results Analysis and Discussion) included a discussion on the differences between the results in R and SAS.
To sum up, all the three determined objectives of this research have been met effectively.
